# DemosceneFX
Repository for my Final Degree Job at the University of Alicante.

The necessary libs are at the lib folder.

I'm using the University of ALicante TinyPTC for managing window.

If you want to check some of the classic FX follow these instructions:

#1. Execute makefiles in each of the libs folders.
#2. Once you have libs, execute the makefile of the FX to enjoy.

Advices for FX are welcomed and if you are a Demoscener I would enjoy
to meet you and talk about that age and about Graphic FX.
